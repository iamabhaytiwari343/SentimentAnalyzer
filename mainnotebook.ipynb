Infelizmente, tendo sido torturado com Date Movie e Epic Movie, sei exatamente o que esperar desses dois ... nenhum enredo, nenhuma piada, apenas más referências e cenas refeitas de outros filmes. Alguém deveria ter informado a eles que a sátira é mais do que apenas copiar e colar de um filme para outro, embora eu não deva dizer isso porque alguns deles realme...  \n",
       "2  Realmente, eu poderia escrever uma crítica contundente sobre esse sanduíche de cocô, mas, em vez disso, vou fazer algumas observações e pontos que deduzi. Não há mais sentido assistir a esses filmes. Algum leitor por aí se lembra do filme de terror? Lembra como era original, com alguns elementos cômicos? Havia palhaçada, algumas frases engraçadas, era uma comédia bastante esquecível, mas valia o preço da entrada. Bem, essa foi a última vez que essa premissa foi engraçada. PARE DE FAZER ESTES FILMES. POR FAVOR, eu poderia pedir um boicote a esses pedaços de macaco, mas todos sabemos que haverá uma fila de buggers irritantes e pré-pubescentes, jorrando uns forros ruins como: \"ISTO É SPARTA!\" e \"IM RICK JAMES BITCH\", para que esses filmes continuem gerando algum ganho monetário, considerando que o valor de produção deste filme parece custar cerca de 10 centavos de dólar. Não gaste dinheiro com isso. Vá para casa, alugue a Airplane, ria e julgue silenciosamente as pessoas que estão fal...  \n",
       "3  Se você viu os outros filmes falsificados anteriores por esses dois senhores horríveis, deve saber que isso já será ruim. Vou lhe dizer a verdade, se você quiser vê-lo como uma pessoa sem cérebro (ironicamente para os adolescentes estereotipados, o que eu não sou), então você rirá um pouco. Mas se você julgar, mesmo que um pouco, o filme falha automaticamente. Por quê? Nunca pergunte isso quando se trata desses dois homens. Lembre-se dos bons e velhos tempos de Hollywood, sempre que fazer um filme era mostrar às pessoas um tipo de arte e também uma história que o mantinha na ponta do seu assento? Bem, sempre que a notícia de que fazer filmes ganhava muito dinheiro, então todas essas pessoas gananciosas apareciam na imagem e é bastante patético. Esses dois não são exceção. Ainda temos artistas de filmes (principalmente o gênio Christopher Nolan). Mas esses dois caras simplesmente ... bem, eu tenho escrito palavras tão grandes, deixe-me colocar em termos simples para esses caras ... ...  \n",
       "4                                 Este filme eu vi um dia cedo de graça e ainda sinto que fui enganado. É totalmente morte cerebral. Arrotando, chutando a virilha e os peitos por todo o lugar. Coxo. O que há de errado com a sociedade, que filmes como esse são feitos? As paródias eram todas horrendas e pouco engraçadas. O enredo foi sem brilho, na melhor das hipóteses, e a atuação foi superficial, transparente e realmente bastante desnecessária. Alguém vê \"Idiocracia\"? Lembra do filme que ganhou todos os prêmios da academia no futuro? Bem, este é esse filme. Eu não vi um filme de baixa qualidade mais rançoso. \"Date Movie\" foi bom, The Scary Movies pelo menos teve enredos decentes, mas isso faz \"spoofs\" (se é que posso dizer assim) para este ano 0 para 3, com \"Meet the Spartans\" e \"Filme de super-heróis\" todos caindo. Bem, eu perdi ainda mais da minha vida digitando sobre esse saco de esterco de vaca. Então, apesar de tudo, não assista a este filme, a menos que o seu QI seja inferior a 80.  "
